# refactorHomework

## Description:

- This project's purpose is to improve the current code by fixing broken links, replacing tags with proper simantic HTML and adding helpful comments by following industry standards.
- The project helped me learn proper simantic HTML, how to use the browser console in order to identify sections of the page within the code and debug link issues.
